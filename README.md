Link: https://info-6150-a1.vercel.app/
## Purpose
This assignment gives you your first taste of working with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** — the basic front-end web technologies.  
It will help you:
- Establish a basic workflow using these technologies.
- Practice with GitHub (create repositories, branches, commits, pull requests, and merges).
- Upload and share your work publicly.
## Task
1. If you don’t have a GitHub account yet, create one at [github.com](https://github.com) using a **personal email address** (not school/work).
2. Follow the provided tutorial to:
    - Create a **new repository**.
    - Create a **branch**.
    - Make a **commit**.
    - Open a **pull request** and merge it back into the main branch.
3. Add today’s practice files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) to your repository.
4. After merging, sync the results so that the files appear on GitHub.
5. Submit the **URL to your public repository**.
