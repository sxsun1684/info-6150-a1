        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a graduate student at Northeastern University, focusing on
            <abbr title="Machine Learning Engineer">MLE</abbr>.
            I enjoy building recommendation systems and fine-tuning large language models.

        <p>
            I chose to study Web technologies not just to build web pages, but to better understand the
            overall workflow of recommendation systems. From front end to back end, the web is the first
            gateway through which users interact with a recommender. By learning <em>HTML / CSS / JavaScript</em>, I can
            design more effective user interaction logging, which provides higher-quality data for recommendation algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
            For recommendation systems, data is the core. Understanding how <strong>data flows</strong> are collected,
            transmitted, and presented helps me connect user interaction logs with the
            distributed computing model. For example, user clicks, browsing, and search
            behaviors can be broken into small data units processed in the Map phase, then aggregated in the
            <code>Reduce</code> phase into features that drive training and ranking.
        </p>
        <p>
            Learning Web development allows me to connect <strong>algorithms and engineering</strong> more tightly:
            the front end captures user behavior and displays personalized results, while the back end and distributed
            systems handle large-scale data processing. This forms a closed loop that not only improves recommendation
            performance but also deepens my understanding of system architecture as a whole.
